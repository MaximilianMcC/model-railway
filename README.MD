# Model Railway
This has the electronics and control system for my OO gauge model railway. It is all powered by an Arduino Mega.

Operation can be done via a physical lever frame, and also digitally. Everything happens in the Arduino.

# Railway lore
The railway is based in a fictional part of England somewhere in the west midlands. The layout is in a fictional part of what was the LNWR, but is now operated by the grouping companies GWR and LMS.

The layout is based in a semi-industrial goods yard. The whole town area thing is located on the edge of the English countryside as it branches into a sort of industrial section of the UK. Both the countryside of the Great Western, and the metropolitan aspects of the LMS are present.

The time period is around the 1930's to early 1940's, however there is currently no set date. Steam is still the main thing that powers Great Britain and the world. Accuracy doesn't really matter to me
